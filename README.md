# awesome-autism

A list of public figures who have been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome or autistic spectrum disorder.

This list exists for the following reasons:

1. To foster autistic pride
2. I like making lists ;-)

The list is in alphabetical order of first name.

## Confirmed

People who have stated they received an official diagnosis from a medical professional.
