# awesome-autism

A list of public figures who have been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome or autistic spectrum disorder.

This list exists for the following reasons:
1) To foster autistic pride
2) I like making lists ;-)

The lists are in alphabetical order of first name.

## Confirmed

People who have stated they have been officialy diagnosed by a doctor.
