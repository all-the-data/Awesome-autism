# awesome-autism

A list of public figures who MIGHT HAVE Asperger syndrome or autism spectrum disorder.

The list is in alphabetical order of first name.

## Maybe

- People who either have said they are autistic but don't have an official diagnosis
- Or people who exhibit some of the traits of autism (purely subjective opinion).
- Or historical figures (i.e. before 1943) whose documented behaviour and comorbidities could possibly be speculated to indicate autism.
- I hope this list does not hurt anyone's feelings, it is written with love.
